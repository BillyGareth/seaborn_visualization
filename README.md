# Seaborn_visualization {Python}
## Why use Python Seaborn?
As mentioned earlier, the Python Seaborn library is used to ease the challenging task of data visualization and it’s based on Matplotlib.
Seaborn allows the creation of statistical graphics through the following functionalities:

An API that is based on datasets allowing comparison between multiple variables

Supports multi-plot grids that in turn ease building complex visualizations

Univariate and bivariate visualizations available to compare between subsets of data

Availability of different color palettes to reveal various kinds of patterns

Estimates and plots linear regression automatically

So, if you were wondering as to why use Seaborn when you already have Matplotlib, here is the answer to it.

Python Seaborn vs Matplotlib:
“If Matplotlib “tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible”, seaborn tries to make a well-defined set of hard things easy too” – Michael Waskom (Creator of Seaborn).
